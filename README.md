### For this project I chose to use react-native since I had to develop this app under 12 hours in an overnight hackathon and making it work for both android and ios seemed more efficient to me. This app majorly relies on the database provided to me by CosyLab but since this app requires the auth token for their api this app might not work for you. For the backend I kept it simple and used Firebase since the database is not that big but in future I will migrate to a custom backend.

# How to Setup ?

Step1: Clone this Repository into your local machine

Step2: Go inside the folder and run "npm install"

Step3: Replace the api key for the various services as the old one will not work (private api key)

Step4: Use your Firebase credentials and change data accordingly

Step5: To Start the App run "npm run start"

# Thank You !
